uses 'greedy' algorithm.
if the hospital moves from i to i-1, then the total cost of villiages on the left( <= i-1) will be decreased by 1*(sum of weight), and right( >= i) increased by 1*(sum of weight).
So as long as the sum of weight on the left outweighs the right, we move the hospital to the left by one village.
So we move step by step until the point where moving one more step, and the total cost increases.
