simulates the process of choosing members.
Each time, A, B and C chooses their favourite member in order.
For one coach, if the favourite has been chosen, then go to the second favourite one. (and down to the third)
Every time, exactly 3 people will be chosen, and every coach will definitely get a member until
when finally after a loop, there are less than 3 members left for chosen. Deal with this case outside the loop.
uses hash[] to store which coach the member belong to.
