# dsa_learning
This repo stores the programs and records the learning process of **Rui Wang** in the course **DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHM**, Tsinghua University, 2016 fall. Programs are named according to their function. For example, the program longest_common_sequence.cpp is used to solve the problem of finding the longest common sequence of two strings using dynamic programming. All programs in this repo will be written in C++.

In specific, files ending with .txt are explanations for algorithms implemented in this program.
